    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed the screen, paper, or in other media. </li><br>
        <li><span class="item1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="item2">CSS saves a lot of work,</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li class="item3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documebts in 3 ways: </h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
         <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements !</li>
         <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
         <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
         <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="item2">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
         </ul>
     
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, aplies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selector are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There ia a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID, Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
